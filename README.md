## Introduction

![EMR-Project](README.assets/EMR-Project.png)

​	This project is created for National Computer Designing and Programming Contest 2019  in China and wins the fisrt-class Prize for our team.It is designed to process `Raw Electronic Medical Records` of clinical cancer diagnosis into structured medical data. We also deploy a website to input data ,process on the cloud and  visualize results online. It can also support online altering the result online and outputing results into local.

​	The main procedure is shown on the flow chart above. You can also find the details and explanation of different parts in the following.

## Requirements

### Website System Requirements:

* pandas >= 0.22.0
* matplotlib >= 2.1.2
* Flask >= 0.12.2
* Flask-Booststrap >= 3.3.7.1

### EMR System Requirements:

* pandas==0.23.4
* pyltp==0.2.1
* jieba==0.39
* tensorflow==1.8.0

Of course the codes can run on  Linux/Unix System which satisfies the requirements above, But if you just want to have a glance at the project, I really recommend you to visit http://120.79.71.189:5000/records/ in case there are some techinical reasons which bring about bugs.

Since the Server is in China, loading page may cost a lot of time than expected. I beg your forgiveness and patience.
